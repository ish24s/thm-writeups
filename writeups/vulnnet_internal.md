## 📝 Room Description
This is a room that highly focuses on internal networks/systems rather than more common areas like  web-applications. Most of the work will be done in the terminal instead of on a browser.

> Note: Research is your best friend.
> Especially for beginners, many of the tools and systems/applications in this room may be new to you so if something looks unfamiliar please take the time to do research before consulting writeups.
